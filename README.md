# What will I need to install? 
(1) A sample code editor you can download is Sublime. Go to https://www.sublimetext.com/3.

If you already have Sublime installed on your machine, you don't have to install this version. Choose the OS X or Windows depending on which operating system you have. 

(2) Download Node: https://nodejs.org/en/
